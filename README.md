## Overview of the App

Women are an underrepresented group in the STEM field. We aim at giving the women around us a clear exposure to technology by serving various means like -
1. Updating them about various diversity hiring opportunities
2. Pave way for women to become financially independent
3. Give exposure to women about the real world scenarios faced by other women and what are the steps they took to overcome the same

<h2>There are 3 different sections in the app as follows</h2> 

1. <b>Scholarship & Opportunities</b> - Provides a list of opportunities which are specifically targetted for women & non binary people as a part of diversity          hiring to encourage more and more women to join the tech world. It also contains link to a list of articles for that particular opportunity so that one can get a detailed view about the opportunity and they don't need to separately search for information regarding the same.

2. <b>Job Updates & Details</b> - Provides a list of recent internship & job openings only for female candidates for various tech & no tech roles so that women can attain financial stability. Job Posters have their job position, company name, hiring member name, stipend, contact details posted so that job seekres can directly contact them for further details.

3. <b>Experiences & Understanding</b> - Provides insights about the real life experiences and problems faced by women in various parts of the country and also includes the solutions and measures taken by those women to deal with the problems. This will lead to women safety because they can follow the same steps as the other women did in their case. It also acts as a source of inspiration for other women in dealing with real life problems.
